# ModEleSys electronics
The backplanes and modules of the ModEleSys are stored here.
Backplanes are prefixed with ```bp``` and some extra description.
Mmodules are prefixed with ```mod``` and size in the form of ```?x?``` where ? would be the size indicator. For example ```mod_1x1_symmetric_powersupply``` is a module of 1x1 that contains a symmetric powersupply.
## Backplanes
* [Passive backplane](bp_passive_10x10_alubox/README.md) with power switches and LED's
## Modules
* [symmetrical powersupply](mod_1x1_PSU_2xAC_flexible/README.md) using AC power input, two AC inputs available for symmetrical or unsymmetrical.
* 1x1 symmetrical powersupply using DC power input
* 1x2 low power symmetrical powersupply using 9V batteries
* LPC812 microcontroller board
* STM32G031 microcontroller board
